- IPC(Inter-Process Communication): includes `shared memory` and `message queues`. sometimes combine with `semaphore` to handle data write and read.

## semaphore
a special variable only is available to do `wait(P(), passeren in Holland. Mean pass or up)` and `signal(V(), vrijgeven in Holland. Mean release or down)` behavior.

sudo code:
{% highlight ruby %}
semaphore sv = 1;

loop forever {
	P(sv);
	critical code section;
	V(sv);
	noncritical code section;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### semaphore on Linux:
{% highlight ruby %}
# "sys/types.h" and "sys/ipc.h" might included before "sys/sem.h"
#include <sys/sem.h>
{% endhighlight %}

* control semaphore information
{% highlight ruby %}
int semctl(int sem_id, int sem_num, int command, ...);
	=> sem_id: semaphore identifier. Return value of semget()
	=> sem_num: (number of semaphore. Usually is 0. Not 0 if use semaphore array)
	=> command: control behavior. ex SETVAL(init semaphore to a value), and IPC_RMID(remove a semaphore identifier)
	=> ...: need to apply structure of union semum if exist.
			union semum {
				int val;
				struct semid_ds *buf;
				unsigned short *array;
			}
# For More info, refer to semctl document
{% endhighlight %}

* create a new semaphore or get semaphore from an existed key
{% highlight ruby %}
int semget(key_t key, int num_sems, int sem_flags);
	=> key: an unique integer for the semaphore
	=> num_sems: number of semaphore. Usually is 1
	=> sem_flags: flags like IPC_CREATE, IPC_EXCL, etc. Behavior please refer to official document
	=> RETURN: a positive integer represents semaphore identifier
{% endhighlight %}

* change semaphore value
{% highlight ruby %}
int semop(int sem_id, struct sembuf \*sem_ops, size_t num_sem_ops);
	=> sem_id: semaphore identifier. Return value of semget()
	=> struct sembuf {
		short sem_num; (number of semaphore. Usually is 0. Not 0 if use semaphore array)
		short sem_op; (value of semaphore to change to. Usually are +1, means up, and -1, means down)
		short sem_flg; (usually SEM_UNDO, operating system will release this semaphore is unexpectedly abandoned)
	=> num_sem_ops: number of semaphore to change
{% endhighlight %}

## shared memory
- open a shared memory for processes to share same memory to each other. but the `synchronization` problem should be handled by engineer.

{% highlight ruby %}
# sys/types.h and sys/ipc.h might included before sys/shm.h
#include <sys/shm.h>
{% endhighlight %}

- create shared memory
{% highlight ruby %}
int shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg);
	=> key: a unique integer of shared memory block
	=> size: size of memory (byte)
	=> shmflg: IPC_CREAT, etc. Can use to decide the shared memory permission
	=> RETURN: a shared memory identifier
{% endhighlight %}

- attach a shared memory to process address
{% highlight ruby %}
void \*shmat(int shm_id, const void \*shm_addr, int shmflg);
	=> shm_id: shared memory identifier. Return value fo shmget()
	=> shm_addr: the address of shared memory wanted to attach. Usually is NULL pointer. Let the system decides the address.
	=> shmflg: SHM_RND(define shared memory address by engineer, not system), or SHM_RDONLY(let shared memory to be read only)
	=> RETURN: the pointer to the shared memory if success. -1 if failed
{% endhighlight %}

- detach the shared memory link from current process
{% highlight ruby %}
int shmdt(const void \*shm_addr);
	=> shm_addr: the returned pointer got from shmat()
	=> RETURN: 0 if success. -1 if failed. The shared memory will still exist after shmdt() success
{% endhighlight %}

- control shared memory with behavior
{% highlight ruby %}
int shmctl(int shm_id, int command, struct shmid_ds \*buf);
	=> shm_id: shared memory identifier
	=> command: behavior to the shared memory. IPC_STAT(store information of the shared memory into struct shmid_ds), IPC_SET(if process has write permission, set the shared memory to struct shmid_ds value), IPC_RMID(remove the shared memory)
	=> buf: structure pointer of:
		strcut shmid_ds {
			uid_t shm_perm.uid 
			uid_t shm_perm.gid
			mode_t shm_perm.mode
		}
	=> RETURN: 0 if success. -1 if failed. If delete a shared memory being used by others process, the behavior is undefined. The shared memory might retain until the last process finished. Don't rely on this uncertainty
{% endhighlight %}

## message queue
- provide a method for a process to send data to another process. Each data can be a `type`. Process can receive different type of data.
- But `one message queue has max size limitation`, and `the length of message queue in a system also has a limitation`. You can get the limitation by `MSGMAX` and `MSGMNB`

{% highlight ruby %}
int msgget(key_t key, int msgflg);
	=> key: a unique integer for message queue
	=> msgflg: IPC_CREAT, etc
	=> RETURN: message queue identifier. -1 if failed
{% endhighlight %}

- send a message into message queue
{% highlight ruby %}
int msgsnd(int msqid, const void \*msg_ptr, size_t msg_sz, int msgflkg);
	=> msqid: the message queue identifier
	=> msg_ptr: pointer to a structure of message. It has two limitation, 1. size must be smaller than system limitation 2. must start with a type of long int.
		strcut my_message {
			long int message_type;
			...
			/* DATA WISH TO TRANSFER */
			...
		}
	=> msg_sz: size of msg_ptr. Exclude the size of the type long int
	=> msgflg: control behavior under certain condition. Ex: IPC_NOWAIT. if message queue is full, function will return -1 instantly, and discard the message. If the flag is not set, process will be blocked until message is sent
	RETURN: 0 if success, -1 if fail. Message will be sent into message queue after success
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
int msgrcv(int msqid, void \*msg_ptr, size_t msg_sz, long int msgtype, int msgflg);
	=> msqid: the message queue identifier
	=> msg_ptr: same structure as msgsnd(). must start with a type of long int
	=> msg_sz: size of msg_ptr. Exclude the size of the type long int
	=> msgtype: if is 0, get the first message in message queue. if is bigger than 0, get the first message with msgtype. if is smaller than 0, get the first message with type of msgtype or a message with smaller type value to the absolute value of msgtype
	=> msgflg: control behavior under certain condition. Ex: IPC_NOWAIT. if message queue is empty, the function will retunr instantly. If the flag is not set, the process will be blocked until certain type of message received from message queue
	=> RETURN: return the size of received message. The received message will be put into msg_ptr, and delete the message in the message queue
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
int msgctl(int msqid, int command, struct msqid_ds \*buf);
	=> msqid: the message queue identifier
	=> command: IPC_STAT(store message queue information into structure msqid_ds), IPC_SET(set message queue information to the value inside msqid_ds), IPC_RMID(delete message queue)
	=> msqid: structure pointer of
		struct msqid_ds {
			uid_t msg_perm.uid;
			uid_t msg_perm.gid;
			mode_t msg_perm.mode;
		}
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, -1 if failed. If process is blocked by msgsnd or msgrcv but the message queue is deleted, the msgsnd or msgrcv will return fail right away
