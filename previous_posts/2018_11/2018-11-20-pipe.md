# Pipe

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

FILE *popen(const char *command, const char *open_mode);
	=> command: command to execute
	=> open_mode: "r" means read, or "w" means write
	=> RETURN: a file pointer to the pipe
int pclose(FILE *stream_to_close);
	=> stream_to_close: file pointer returned by popen()
	=> RETURN: end code of the closed process. -1 if failed. If the end code cannot be got, -1 will be returned too
```

``` c
#include <unistd.h>

int pipe(int file_descriptor[2]);
	=> file_descriptor[2]: array of two integers
	=> RETURN: 0 if successfully assign the array of two integers, -1 if failed

	=> file_descriptor[0] is pipe-to-read, file_descriptor[1] is pipe-to-write
```

- if a process open a read pipe and use read function to read data. If on the other side, there is a write pipe opened but doesn't have data write in, the read function will be blocked to wait for data. But if there is `NO` write pipe opened on the other side, the read function will receive `0`(indicating like an end of file).
ps: if the file descriptor is invalid, the return value of the read function will be `-1`. 


``` c
#include <unistd.h>

int dup(int file_descriptor);
	=> file_descriptor: duplicate this descriptor to the least unused file descritor
	=> RETURN: new file descriptor if success, or -1 if failed
int dup2(int file_descriptor_one, int file_descriptor_two);
	=> descriptor_one: file descriptor want-to-copy
	=> descriptor_two: target unused file descriptor to-be-replace, or choose the least unused file descriptor bigger than descriptor_two to-be-replace
```


# named pipe (also called FIFO)
- a special type of file existing in file system. Every process knows this named pipe can open it to read or write and communicate


``` c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int mkfifo(const char *filename, mode_t mode);
	=> filename: absolute path to create a named pipe file
	=> mode: the named pipe permission. ex: 0777
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, -1 if failed
```

- use open() to open a (named pipe) file and use, and close() to close a (named pipe) file

``` c
#include <fcntl.h>

int open(const char *path, int oflag, ...);
	=> path: absolute path of file to open
	=> oflag: O_RDONLY(read permission only), O_WRONLY(write permission only), O_NONBLOCK(not blocked to wait for data becoming available), etc
	=> RETURN: non-negative integer if success, -1 if failed

int close(int fildes);
	=> fildes: file descriptor want-to-close
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, -1 if failed
```
