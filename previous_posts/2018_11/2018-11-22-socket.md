- socket: a connection between client and server. Both Server and Client need to prepare something to create socket
Server: Call `socket()` to create a socket. Call `bind()` to bind certain port on server. Call `listen()` to listen request from server. Call `accept()` to accept rrequest from client. Call `close()` after finish using socket
Client: Call `socket()` to create socket. Call `connect()` to connect to server. Then client can have communication with server. Call `close()` adter finish using socket


## Socket
socket has three properties: `domain`, `type`, and `protocol`

- domain: consist of server's ip and port number. `AF_INET` means IPv4 domain, `AF_INET6` means IPv6 domain. `AF_UNIX` means the computer its own. The connection is built on a socket file under a directory. The port number represent one service on server. Ex: `ftp(port 21)`, `httpd(port 80)`, etc.

- type: `SOCK_STREAM`, and `SOCK_DGRAM`. SOCK_STREAM is TCP/IP protocol in AF_INET. It provides continuous, and reliable stream tunnel for client and server to communicate. SOCK_DGRAM is UDP/IP protocol in AF_INET. It provides discontinuous, unreliable transmittion for client and server. But the cost of the transmittion can be reduce to minimum

- protocol: specify protocol to be used with the socket.


{% highlight ruby %}
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <sys/socket.h>

int socket(int domain, int type, int protocol);
	=> domain: AF_UNIX(file system socket), AF_INET(IPv4 network socket), etc.
	=> type: SOCK_STREAM(TCP/IP), SOCK_DGRAM(UDP/IP)
	=> protocol: domain and type usually decide the protocol of the socket, so protocol usually is 0 to represent default protocol
	=> RETURN: a file descriptor representing the socket. Can be used in write() and read(), and close() after finish using the socket
{% endhighlight %}

- socket address: the address of the socket. Used in bind() or connect(), etc

struct socket address of AF_UNIX socket:
{% highlight ruby %}
struct sockaddr_un {
	sa_family_t	sun_family; (protocol AF_UNIX)
	char	sun_path[]; (file path name)
};
{% endhighlight %}

struct socket address of AF_INET socket:
{% highlight ruby %}
struct sockaddr_in {
	short int	sin_family; (protocol AF_INET)
	unsigned short int	sin_port; (port number)
	struct in_addr	sin_addr; (Internet address)
		=> struct in_addr {
				unsigned long int	s_addr; (32bits, 8bits(number 0-255) * 4(IPv4))
			};
};
{% endhighlight %}

### server

bind a name to a socket
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <sys/socket.h>

int bind(int socket, const struct sockaddr \*address, size_t address_len);
	=> socket: the file descriptor returned by socket()
	=> address: the struct of the socket address
	=> address_len: size of the second parameter adress
	=> RETURN: 0 if sucess, -1 if fail and errno will be set
{% endhighlight %}

create a queue for the connections to a socket
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <sys/socket.h>

int listen(int socket, int backlog);
	=> socket: file descriptor returned by socket()
	=> backlog: the number of available pending client request when server is busy. if not set, the pending client will be directly rejected
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, 1 if failed
{% endhighlight %}

accept the connection
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <sys/socket.h>
int accpet(int socket, struct sockaddr \*address size_t \*address_len);
	=> socket: the file descriptor returned by socket()
	=> address: the connected client address information
	=> address_len: the desired client address size. If the real size is bigger than that, the data will be trimmed. After this function call, the value will be the real client struct address size(it will be equal or smaller than the desired size)
	=> RETURN: new file descriptor of the socket connected with the client

{% endhighlight %}


- can add O_NONBLOCK flag in fcntl() to change the blocking behavior at the socket accept(). The accept() will return -1 instantly if current no pending client connection

fcntl: manipulate file descriptor
{% highlight ruby %}
int flags = fcntl(socket, F_GETFL, 0);
fcntl(socket, F_SETFL, O_NONBLOCK | flags);
{% endhighlight %}


### client side

connect the socket to server
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <sys/socket.h>
int connect(int socket, const struct sockaddr \*address, size_t address_len);
	=> socket: the file descriptor returned by socket()
	=> address: the want to connect server address
	=> address_len: the size of the want to connect server address
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, 1 if failed and will set errno

can also use O_NONBLOCK flag in fcntl() to set nonblocking mode to connect()
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight ruby %}
close() to close socket on client and server
{% endhighlight %}

- the address field in the struct sockaddr on server side decides which ip can connect to the socket. Using `INADDR_ANY` to let everyone on the internet can connect to this socket is a general case.


## Byte Order
Intel Core byte order is MSB(mosty significant byte). IBM Core byte order is LSB(Least significant byte). Due to different byte order of the computer, client and server should transfer the its byte order to internet byte order expression

change host name to network byte order. If the byte order of the host name is already the same as internet byte order, this function will do nothing. "l" means, long, 32bits, and "s" means, short, 16bits
- `Port` number is unsinged short. Use htons()
- `address` is unsigned long. Use htonl()

{% highlight ruby %}
#include netinet/in.h>

unsigned long int htonl(unsigned long int hostlong);
unsigned short int htons(unsgined short int hostshort);
unsigned long int ntohl(unsinged long int netlong);
unsigned short int ntohs(unsigned short int netshort);
{% endhighlight %}

## network information

get desired hostname information. If no information received, get NULL pointer
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <netdb.h>

struct hostent \*gethostbyaddr(const void \*addr, size_t len, int type);
	=> addr: desired hostname struct in_addr
		struct in_addr	sin_addr; (Internet address)
		=> struct in_addr {
				unsigned long int	s_addr; (32bits, 8bits(number 0-255) * 4(IPv4))
			};
	=> len: size of the hostname struct
	=> type: AF_INET, or AF_INET6
struct hostent \*gethostbyname(const char \*name);
	=> name: either a hostname or an IPv4 address or IPv6 address

	Both RETURN: a struct hostent
		struct hostent {
			char *h_name; (name of the host)
			char **h_aliases; (list of aliases, nicknames)
			int h_addrtype; (address type, AF_INET or AF_INET6)
			int h_length; (length in bytes of the address)
			char **h_addr_list; (list of address (network order)
		}
{% endhighlight %}

need to call inet_ntoa() to transform address to readable string
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <arpa/inet.h>

char \*inet_ntoa(struct in_addr in);
	=> in: struct in_addr of desired address
	=> RETURN: readable string of the address (IPv4: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx)
{% endhighlight %}

output current computer hostname into parameter
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <unistd.h>

int gethostname(char \*name, int namelength);
	=> name: a pointer to store current computer hostname
	=> namelength: desired length of the name. The name will be trimmed if real name is longer than namelength
	=> RETURN: 0 if success, -1 if failed
{% endhighlight %}

get desired serice entry. If no information received, get NULL pointer
{% highlight ruby %}
#include <netdb.h>

struct servent \*getservbyname(const char \*name, const char \*proto);
	=> name: name of the service
	=> proto: NULL if any protocol or "tcp", "udp"
struct servent \*getservbyport(int port, const char \*proto);
	=> port: desired service port number
	=> proto: NULL if any protocol or "tcp", "udp"

	Both RETURN: a struct servent
		struct servent {
			char *s_name; (name of the service)
			char **s_aliases; (list of aliases, alternative names)
			int s_port; (IP port number in network byte order)
			char *s_proto; (service protocol. "tcp" or "udp")
		}
		
{% endhighlight %}
