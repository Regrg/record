# Mindset
organize from previous interview experiences

### MUST complete the main answer
- Do not provide an answer which is not workable
- Whether the answer is good or bad, prioritize completing a workable solutions you can think of
- A brute-force solution is also acceptable

### Don't be afraid to ask for hint
- In order to complete a workable solution mustly and save unnecessary time, ask for hint when you get stuck
- Ask for hint at the beginning is also acceptable

### Mock API to focus on the main answer
- In order to stay focus on completing a workable solution
- Remove time to dig into the detail

### Explain algorithm to the interviewer
- Interviewer must have quesiton and advise. Explain solution to let everyone understand
- Recommend to explain along the solving process
- If you don't want to be distracted, explain after finishing solution is also acceptable

### Explain complexity to the interviewer
- In order to prove you understand the solution's efficiency, calculate the time and space complexity of the solution
- Both before and after optimizing the solution, you need to understand the solution's efficiency
